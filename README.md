# RpiRover1
Basic raspberry pi rover

## Introduction
This project uses a Flask server with a SocketIO connection between server and client to communicate.

The data that is transmitted thus far is accelerometer data from a mobile device connected to the server.

## Next steps:
Build touch screen controller to replace accelerometer input (fun but not practical)

Add motor trim inputs with variable storage

add logging for inputs, socket sessions, sensory outputs, and motor controller commands

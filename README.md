Basic raspberry pi rover

## Introduction
This project uses a Flask server with a SocketIO connection between server and client to communicate.

The data that is transmitted thus far is accelerometer data from a mobile device connected to the server.

## Next steps:
On the server side, convert the accelerometer data to acceptable inputs for the motor controller.

Send dummy data from the server to the motor controller to test communications

Add buttons to the client user interface to start up or shut down the motor controller

Send accelerometer data from the client to the motor controller

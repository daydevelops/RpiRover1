Basic raspberry pi rover

## Introduction
This project uses a Flask server with a SocketIO connection between server and client to communicate.

## Next steps:
scale speed and heading inputs, add "spring" to joystick (return to zero), and feed values to motor controller

add logging for inputs, socket sessions, sensory outputs, and motor controller commands
